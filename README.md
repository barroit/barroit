                                About barroit

Here's Jiamu Sun, aka barroit. A Miku devotee, hardcore Vocaloid fan. Lives on
their tracks in Japan with Miku, Teto, Luka, Gumi, and Akari. I go whenever they
perform, including Vocaloid events, and sometimes go out with my dodeka Miku.

I started programming in my first year of high school. As I learned different
design ways, read their practices, watched how open source projects do things,
and got burned over and over again, my philosophy changed a lot.

Now I'm a purely procedural guy. No overengineering crap in the source, no
obscure parts, no hidden behaviors, and no IDE features in my environment. I
stick with VS Code and Vim for source work and small edits. Workflow's fully
integrated with Git and CLI.

	DIY PC
	web backend and frontend
	game mod
	CLI program and framework
	LLM program
	Discord bot
	DIY firmware
	embedded system
	environment init system
	reusable code and config setup
	Vocaloid songs
